 The `JumpCoreImageDownloadReceipt` is an object vended by the `JumpCoreImageDownloader` when starting a data task. It can be used to cancel active tasks running on the `JumpCoreImageDownloader` session. As a general rule, image data tasks should be cancelled using the `JumpCoreImageDownloadReceipt` instead of calling `cancel` directly on the `task` itself. The `JumpCoreImageDownloader` is optimized to handle duplicate task scenarios as well as pending versus active downloads.
