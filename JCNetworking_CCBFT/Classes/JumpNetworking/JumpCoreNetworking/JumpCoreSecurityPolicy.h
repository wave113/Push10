 `JumpCoreSecurityPolicy` evaluates server trust against pinned X.509 certificates and public keys over secure connections.

 Adding pinned SSL certificates to your app helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and other vulnerabilities. Applications dealing with sensitive customer data or financial information are strongly encouraged to route all communication over an HTTPS connection with SSL pinning configured and enabled.
